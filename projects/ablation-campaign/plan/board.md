Append-only, newest first. Anyone (person or agent) posts here: findings,
doubts, proposals, things that surprised you. Fold the settled part into the

## 2026-09-15 — Claude (Fable 5.1, research-buddy session) — Plan folder created; the August baseline is a failed alignment

Context: three-turn strategy session with the PI on how to organise the
campaign, then two added commitments (24 EU languages, the Fondue run).

Findings:
- MA eval loss 2.6–3.1 and WER > 1.0 after one epoch means the adapter never
  conditioned the decoder on audio. Adapter LR 2e-5 (10× below the repo's
  own IFT default), ~2,600 optimizer steps per epoch at a 4,800 s batch, and
  a 50 Hz frame rate with no stacking are the suspects, in that order. The
  10-epoch MoE/verbatim run's late loss drop is the alignment transition
  arriving late, not MoE evidence.
- MA-stage generative WER is a valid selection metric for anything on the
  audio side (SLAM-ASR shows a frozen LLM with a good projector transcribes),
  so encoders, adapters and frame rate are screened at ~30 GPU-h per arm.
- Qwen3.5-2B is dense with hybrid linear attention, not an MoE. Llama vs
  Qwen is also full vs hybrid attention.
- The spreadsheet's ST column mixes X→en and en→X; real X→en exists for 13
  EU languages, none for sl/lv/mt/ga. Tiers 10/30/100/300/700 h are reached
  in full by 24/17/13/8/8 languages.
- Budget: ~49,700 GPU-h remain until 2026-11-30, no renewal. Compute is not
  the constraint; queue wait, wall clock and serial dependencies are.

Action needed: PI reviews `timeline.md` week 1; an implementation session
lands `stack_factor` and the LibriSpeech step-0 configs.
