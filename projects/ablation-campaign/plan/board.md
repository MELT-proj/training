## 2026-09-15 — Claude (strategy session) — FLEURS X→en set specified; the no-audio floor revises the mechanism, not the conclusion

Context: the PI could not find the week-1 item "FLEURS X→en ST set" in the
plan; it was one under-specified timeline line. Also read the no-audio floor
result posted below.

Finding 1: the join is feasible and now specified in `05-language-ladder.md`
§3.1. On the nyx shar tree, 100% of X/test sentence ids (de, it, ga, mt, hu,
lv checked) are present in `en_us/test`, so FLEURS' split assignment is
consistent across languages. The English `pnc_text` differs across duplicate
recordings for 57/350 ids (per-recording truecasing), so the reference must
be chosen deterministically: use the original English transcription from
the FLEURS metadata, with majority `pnc_text` as fallback. Home is
melt-eval (a reader option that overrides the target text by cut id), not
preprocessing; nothing in the shar tree is rewritten.

Finding 2, my reading of the floor: 4.0–4.3 nats with no audio against
2.6–3.1 with audio means the adapter conveys coarse audio-conditioned
information (language identity, register, utterance length, maybe partial
lexical content) worth 1.1–1.5 nats, but not the frame-to-token alignment
transcription needs. That is the coarse-feature plateau; the transition to
fine alignment is what needs more optimizer pressure (LR, steps) and
shorter sequences (stacking). "Failed alignment" stands; "audio was
ignored" is withdrawn. Consequence for step 0: success needs WER *and* an
eval loss well under 1 nat per token on LibriSpeech dev (a working
frozen-LLM ASR should sit around 0.2–0.5), not merely a loss below the
floor. A run whose loss drops while WER stays above 0.5 is repeating the
coarse-signal pattern. `01-interface-recipe.md` §1, its Settled block and
the step-0 interpretation rules are updated; PI to confirm.

Action needed: a melt-eval session takes §3.1. The revised reading was
confirmed by the PI on 2026-09-15.

## 2026-09-15 — Claude (worker session llama-3-2-1b-no-audio-floor-d4bc19) — No-audio floor measured: audio was NOT ignored

Context: week 1 Track A, `01-interface-recipe.md` §1's "no-audio floor"
control. Wrote `no_audio_floor.py` + `no_audio_floor.sbatch` (new,
committed): scores a frozen backbone on the MA validation transcripts,
same chat-templated prompt and label masking the real collator uses, but
`input_features=None` so no audio is ever read from disk (reuses the
collator's own text/tag/template helpers directly instead of
`MELTMapDataset`/`MELTDataCollator`, which call `cut.load_audio()`
unconditionally). Validated with a CPU smoke test (8 cuts/lang, sdpa) inside
the training container on nyx before spending cluster time. First submitted
on artemis (job 331970); cancelled after ~2h queued behind another user's
two jobs occupying all 4 GPUs on the only h100 node. Re-submitted on MN5
under `acc_debug` QOS (job 45888659), completed in 1m20s. Both clusters'
shared checkouts were left untouched — pushed the branch as a new ref and
ran from a `git worktree`, removed after.

Finding: scored frozen Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct on the exact 200-cuts/language
eval subset (same seed) `MA-700asr-w2vbF-llama1bInsF-mlpT-s42-8g-md60`
uses, and pulled that arm's own final (step 2600) `eval_<lang>_loss` from
its `trainer_state.json` for a like-for-like comparison (confirmed via its
`resolved_config.json`: `apply_chat_template: true`, `chat_template_config:
llama3`, so both numbers are on the same eval formatting — the run finished
2026-08-28, after the 2026-08-09 fix that made eval inherit the chat
template):

| lang | no-audio floor | MA eval_loss (with audio) | floor − with-audio |
|---|---|---|---|
| en | 4.073 | 2.948 | +1.125 |
| de | 4.312 | 3.123 | +1.189 |
| fr | 3.968 | 2.739 | +1.229 |
| es | 4.040 | 2.659 | +1.381 |
| it | 4.154 | 2.674 | +1.480 |

**The floor is 1.1–1.5 nats/token *above* the observed MA loss on every
language, not equal to it.** `01-interface-recipe.md` §1 and `00-status.md`
both describe the 2.6–3.1 eval loss as "roughly what a 1B text LM scores
... with no audio" — measured, it is not close; audio conditioning cuts the
loss by ~3–4.4x in per-token perplexity versus no audio at all. So the
adapter did not simply learn to ignore the audio and emit fluent filler;
it learned *something* audio-conditioned that measurably helps next-token
prediction, just not the right thing for correct transcription (WER stayed
1.10–1.16, hypotheses fluent but unrelated to the reference). I've added
the numbers and this reading to `01-interface-recipe.md` §1a rather than
touching the Settled block myself.

Action needed: PI review of the diagnosis in light of this — it doesn't
overturn "the August baseline is a failed alignment" (WER is still
catastrophic) but it does overturn "audio was ignored" as the explanation,
which changes what a passing LibriSpeech screen run should look like (a run
that only drops eval loss without moving WER may be repeating this same
coarse-signal pattern rather than fixing the recipe).

## 2026-09-15 — Claude (worker session fleurs-24-asr-frozen-sets) — FLEURS-24 ASR frozen sets built

Context: week 1 Track B, `05-language-ladder.md` §3 / `timeline.md` week 1
("FLEURS-24 ASR frozen sets in melt-eval"). Branch
`claude/fleurs24-asr-frozen-sets` in `melt-eval`,
[PR #10](https://github.com/MELT-proj/eval/pull/10).

Finding / proposal: added `configs/fleurs24-asr-test.yaml` (full FLEURS
`test`, all 24 EU languages) and `configs/fleurs24-asr-dev.yaml` (~100
utterances/language from FLEURS `validation`, for the in-training generative
round). Froze both against the real shar tree: `fleurs24-asr-test` is 19,463
samples / 63.41 h with zero dropped-no-reference cuts; `fleurs24-asr-dev` is
2,400 samples / 7.41 h. Copied to
`/mnt/scratch-artemis/giuseppe/melt-data/eval-sets/{fleurs24-asr-test,fleurs24-asr-dev}/`.

Checked `custom.pnc_text` coverage directly against the shar tree for all 24
languages, both `test` and `validation` (not previously measured at this
granularity): **23/24 are 100% covered; ga (Irish) has 0% on both splits**
and silently falls back to plain, unpunctuated supervision text
(`get_text_from_cut`, `strict=False`, the training repo's own default). Every
other language's FLEURS reference is cased and punctuated; Irish's is not.
Documented in both spec headers rather than worked around -- fixing it is the
training repo's PNC-backfill/`strict_text_field` decision
([[num-tokens-and-pnc-text-semantics]], [[silent-text-field-fallback]]), out
of scope here. Worth remembering when Irish's ladder numbers look
disproportionately bad or good: part of that could be transcript formatting,
not the model.

Also found: the shared artemis dev venv
(`/mnt/scratch-artemis/giuseppe/venvs/melteval`) editable-installs
`melt-proj` from `melt-eval`'s sibling checkout at
`/mnt/home/giuseppe/melt-proj/training`, which is pinned at `74c7892`
(2026-08-19) -- **before** the transformers 5 migration (`a519e4fe`,
2026-09-01, PR #109). Importing `melt.training` there crashes
(`ValueError: mutable default <class 'dict'> for field sub_configs`) against
the venv's transformers 5.16.1. I froze the sets from nyx instead (training
repo's own `.venv`, current `main`, melt-eval on `PYTHONPATH`) rather than
touching that checkout, since it has unrelated uncommitted local changes
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.gitignore`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`) and its
scratch-side sibling (`/mnt/scratch-artemis/giuseppe/melt-proj-src/melt-eval`,
on `claude/air-bench-support`) has unrelated in-progress work from another
session. Did not touch either.

Action needed: PI review/merge PR #10. Before anyone runs `inspect eval`
(the generation step) against these frozen sets on artemis, sync
`/mnt/home/giuseppe/melt-proj/training` to `main` (or otherwise past
`a519e4fe`) -- generation will crash on import otherwise. FLEURS X→en ST set
construction (the other week-1 Track B eval item) is still open.

## 2026-09-15 — Claude (worker session mlp-adapter-stack-factor-13e900) — stack_factor PR opened

Context: follow-up to the entry directly below, after the PI merged the
plan folder into `main`.

Finding / proposal: rebased the branch onto the updated `main`, re-ran the
full suite in the nyx container (unchanged: only the two pre-existing
failures noted below), and opened
[PR #126](https://github.com/MELT-proj/training/pull/126) against `main`.

Action needed: PI review/merge.

## 2026-09-15 — Claude (worker session mlp-adapter-stack-factor-13e900) — stack_factor implemented for the MLP adapter

Context: week 1 Track B, `01-interface-recipe.md` §4. Branch
`claude/mlp-adapter-stack-factor-13e900`, commit `5822129`, 12 files, local
only until the PI decides on a PR.

Finding: `MELTMLPAdapter` concatenates k consecutive encoder frames along the
feature axis before `fc1` (input width k × encoder hidden size), pads the
frame count to a multiple of k, and subsamples the attention mask by k in
`_get_output_features_shape` with the same prefix-mask assumption the
Conformer adapter uses. New `model.adapter.stack_factor` field, default 1,
byte-identical to the previous adapter. Conformer and Q-Former ignore it.
Wired as a `STACK_FACTOR` campaign axis (env var, `ArmAxes.stack_factor`,
`--model.adapter.stack_factor`), tagged into `EXP_NAME` as `-skN` only when
it differs from the base config, so no existing arm is renamed. Tests added
for fc1 width, exact and non-multiple downsampling, mask subsampling, the
no-mask case, composition with an encoder's own downsampling, config parsing,
and `plan_arm.py` tag composition (its first tests). Full suite in the nyx
container: 452 passed.

Two pre-existing failures found, unrelated to this change and reproduced on
a clean checkout: `TestAttnImplementationPropagation::test_sdpa_reaches_an_encoder_that_has_no_flash_kernel`
(sdpa not propagated into `Wav2Vec2BertConfig`, likely transformers version
skew) and every test in `test_processing_melt.py` (tokenizer fixture's
`add_special_tokens` against Qwen2.5-1.5B). Background tasks queued for both.

Action needed: PI decides push/PR for the branch (12 files, so a PR against
`main` per the protocol). Reviewed at plan level by the strategy session:
padding, reshape and ceil(valid/k) prefix mask look right; end-to-end
validation comes from the LibriSpeech screen's stack=4 runs.

## 2026-09-15 — Claude (Fable 5.1, research-buddy session) — Plan folder created; the August baseline is a failed alignment

Context: three-turn strategy session with the PI on how to organise the
campaign, then two added commitments (24 EU languages, the Fondue run).

Findings:
- MA eval loss 2.6–3.1 and WER > 1.0 after one epoch means the adapter never
  conditioned the decoder on audio. Adapter LR 2e-5 (10× below the repo's
  own IFT default), ~2,600 optimizer steps per epoch at a 4,800 s batch, and
  a 50 Hz frame rate with no stacking are the suspects, in that order. The
  10-epoch MoE/verbatim run's late loss drop is the alignment transition
  arriving late, not MoE evidence.
- MA-stage generative WER is a valid selection metric for anything on the
  audio side (SLAM-ASR shows a frozen LLM with a good projector transcribes),
  so encoders, adapters and frame rate are screened at ~30 GPU-h per arm.
- Qwen3.5-2B is dense with hybrid linear attention, not an MoE. Llama vs
  Qwen is also full vs hybrid attention.
- The spreadsheet's ST column mixes X→en and en→X; real X→en exists for 13
  EU languages, none for sl/lv/mt/ga. Tiers 10/30/100/300/700 h are reached
  in full by 24/17/13/8/8 languages.
- Budget: ~49,700 GPU-h remain until 2026-11-30, no renewal. Compute is not
  the constraint; queue wait, wall clock and serial dependencies are.

Action needed: PI reviews `timeline.md` week 1; an implementation session
lands `stack_factor` and the LibriSpeech step-0 configs.
